# Description

Minimalistic html5 boilerplate with header, main and footer sections. 

# Goal

Goal of the template is to allow the content part to be tiny, and keep the footer at the very bottom. And if the content grows, a vertical scroll bar should appear as you would expect to work on any other website.

# Tech
No package managgers or transformations. Plain simple old **Html** with **Css**.
